The aim of this study is to assess the incidence of congenital heart diseases and other organic defects associated with different types of orofacial clefts. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: All children with orofacial clefts, which were sought out from the Health Information System of Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital between 1(st) Jan 2009 and 30(th) Dec 2011, were enrolled in this study. All subjects underwent a thorough examination and grouped by the cleft phenotype. The numbers and types of other organic defects were recorded and analyzed statistically using SPSS 17.0. Of 2180 cases reported as having orofacial clefts, 657 (30.1%) had other congenital abnormalities, which were significantly more common in cleft palate (47.9% (329\\/687)) than that in cleft lip (10.6% (80\\/755)) or cleft lip and palate (33.6% (248\\/738)) (P<0.01). In subgroups, unilateral cleft lip and palate had a statistically higher incidence of associated abnormalities than bilateral cleft lip and palate (P<0.01). The most common malformation was congenital heart disease, which counted 45.1% (296\\/657) of all malformations. Disorders of the central nervous system (14.3%(94\\/657)) and Skeletal anomalies (13.1%(86\\/657)) were also frequently associated. Additionally, the most common defect in heart was atrial septal defect, which was 39.7% (118\\/296) of all congenital heart diseases.

There is a lack of literature reporting the number of people affected with OFCs due to consanguinity. Aims: The aim of this study is to report the occurrence of OFC and associated factors in relation to consanguinity from a craniofacial hospital specializing in OFCs, head and neck cancer, and trauma management in South India. Setting and Design: This was a hospital-based study, retrospective case record analysis. Methodology: One thousand two hundred and forty-seven consecutive patients' secondary data records with cleft lip (CL), cleft palate (CP) and cleft lip and palate (CL\\/P) were collected from January 2007 to July 2009. Statistics: Frequency of consanguinity in relation to OFC was analyzed using Chi-square test according to the nature of clefts and selected demographic features such as sex, region, and religion. Results: A total of 47.2% patients' parents had consanguineous marriage. Consanguinity was seen in 60.2% of male and 39.7% of female patients. CL\\/P was noticed in 40.9%, followed by CL (36.7%) and CP (22.2%). Males predominated in all types of clefts proportionally with the study population as compared to females. Statistically, significant association (P = 0.04) was seen with consanguinity and CP. Conclusion: Nearly half of the study population had a positive history of consanguinity. Statistically, a significant association was seen between CP and consanguinity. CL\\/P cases were the most common type identified, followed by CL and CP. Males predominated in all types of clefts. The prevalence of OFC is high, and there is a potential of congenital disabilities from consanguinity.

Specimens included normal liver, liver in iron overload, hepatocellular carcinoma, angioma and foetal liver. On light microscopy, immunoreactivity was almost exclusively present on sinusoidal lining cells, apparently endothelial cells; the pattern was similar in normal and in iron-loaded liver. A gradient of more enhanced staining in acinar zone II and III was observed. The endothelial localization of the staining was supported by the positivity of the central vein endothelium and of the angiomas. Immunoelectron microscopy on three liver specimens showed positivity on sinusoidal endothelial cells but not on Ito and Kupffer cells. In addition, positivity on rough endoplasmic reticulum vesicles of some hepatocytes was also present. Four hepatocellular carcinomas showed an intense staining in tumour cells, 3 were weakly positive and 3 were negative. In the foetal livers, the central vein endothelium was positive from 21 weeks of gestation onward and additional positivity of zone III sinusoidal endothelial cells was present from 27 weeks on. The present results show that in the liver melanotransferrin has a localization different from Tf and the TfR. These latter molecules are predominantly localized in parenchymal cells. In addition, there does not appear to be a coordinate regulation secondary to iron storage, between melanotransferrin, Tf and the TfR. The observed gradient in the staining pattern in foetal and adult liver specimens further supports the heterogeneity of the endothelial cell population in the liver and suggests a developmental relationship between endothelial cells of sinusoids and central vein.\"},\"autor\":{\"nombres\":\"Autores 140\"},\"fuente\":{\"fuente\":\"ProQuest\"},\"link\":{\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/dialog.proquest.com\\/professional\\/docview\\/596108683?accountid=173210\"},\"titulo\":{\"title\":\"In situ localization of melanotransferrin (melanoma-associated antigen P97) in human liver.

Four carcinomas in situ exhibited limited invasion into the underlying lamina propria or inner part of the muscle layer. In the 15 cases that were examined, immunoperoxidase stains revealed cytoplasmic staining for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). All patients we were able to follow (those who had only carcinoma in situ) are symptom-free after cholecystectomy.

Quantitative real-time PCR and in situ hybridization were used to measure the expression of miRNA-888 family members (miRNA-888, miRNA-891a, miRNA-891b, miRNA-892a, and miRNA-892b) in HCC tissue, and the association of the expression of miRNA-888, miRNA-891b, and miRNA-892a with the clinicopathological features of HCC was analyzed. The t-test was used for comparison of continuous data between two groups, and the chi-square test was used for comparison of categorical data between two groups.

Subjective side effects were seldom seen and without practical importance for the treatment. Objective, grave side effects were only few: one superficial phlebo-thrombosis, 2 cases of thrombophlebitis, one carcinoma in situ of the portio vaginalis uteri and 2 mammary cancers were seen. The carcinoma had probably no causal relationship to the treatment. Embolies, myocardial infarctions, cerebrovascular and liver-gall bladder complications did not occur during treatment. The rate of uterine bleedings was low. The incidence of all complications was not increased by estriol succinate; but was even lower than expected. Endometrial and ovarian cancers were not seen. Estriol succinate is accordingly a very effective and well tolerated preparation against climacteric complaints, exerting no significant side effects. It is remarkable that it does not proliferate the endometrium when given in one dose a day.

Hepatocellular eosinophilic foci and adenomas were seen after 10 and 15 weeks, respectively. Basophilic foci and adenomas were found after 29 and 40 weeks, respectively. Hepatocellular carcinomas developed in 5 of 10 rats at week 40, in 3 of 5 rats at week 73, and in 19 of 19 rats that lived out their life-span.

Understanding how perturbations in metabolism are related to AD is critical to identifying novel targets for disease-modifying therapies. In this study, we test whether AD pathogenesis is associated with dysregulation in brain transmethylation and polyamine pathways.<h4>Methods and findings<\\/h4>We first performed targeted and quantitative metabolomics assays using capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) on brain samples from three groups in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) (AD: n = 17; Asymptomatic AD [ASY]: n = 13; Control [CN]: n = 13) (overall 37.2% female; mean age at death 86.118 \\u00b1 9.842 years) in regions both vulnerable and resistant to AD pathology. Using linear mixed-effects models within two primary brain regions (inferior temporal gyrus [ITG] and middle frontal gyrus [MFG]), we tested associations between brain tissue concentrations of 26 metabolites and the following primary outcomes: group differences, Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) (neuritic plaque burden), and Braak (neurofibrillary pathology) scores. We found significant alterations in concentrations of metabolites in AD relative to CN samples, as well as associations with severity of both CERAD and Braak, mainly in the ITG. These metabolites represented biochemical reactions in the (1) methionine cycle (choline: lower in AD, p = 0.003; S-adenosyl methionine: higher in AD, p = 0.005); (2) transsulfuration and glutathione synthesis (cysteine: higher in AD, p < 0.001; reduced glutathione [GSH]: higher in AD, p < 0.001); (3) polyamine synthesis\\/catabolism (spermidine: higher in AD, p = 0.004); (4) urea cycle (N-acetyl glutamate: lower in AD, p < 0.001); (5) glutamate-aspartate metabolism (N-acetyl aspartate: lower in AD, p = 0.002); and (6) neurotransmitter metabolism (gamma-amino-butyric acid: lower in AD, p < 0.001). Utilizing three Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets, we then examined mRNA expression levels of 71 genes encoding enzymes regulating key reactions within these pathways in the entorhinal cortex (ERC; AD: n = 25; CN: n = 52) and hippocampus (AD: n = 29; CN: n = 56). Complementing our metabolomics results, our transcriptomics analyses also revealed significant alterations in gene expression levels of key enzymatic regulators of biochemical reactions linked to transmethylation and polyamine metabolism. Our study has limitations: our metabolomics assays measured only a small proportion of all metabolites participating in the pathways we examined. Our study is also cross-sectional, limiting our ability to directly test how AD progression may impact changes in metabolite concentrations or differential-gene expression. Additionally, the relatively small number of brain tissue samples may have limited our power to detect alterations in all pathway-specific metabolites and their genetic regulators.<h4>Conclusions<\\/h4>In this study, we observed broad dysregulation of transmethylation and polyamine synthesis\\/catabolism, including abnormalities in neurotransmitter signaling, urea cycle, aspartate-glutamate metabolism, and glutathione synthesis. Our results implicate alterations in cellular methylation potential and increased flux in the transmethylation pathways, increased demand on antioxidant defense mechanisms, perturbations in intermediate metabolism in the urea cycle and aspartate-glutamate pathways disrupting mitochondrial bioenergetics, increased polyamine biosynthesis and breakdown, as well as abnormalities in neurotransmitter metabolism that are related to AD.\"},\"autor\":{\"nombres\":\"Autores 534\"},\"fuente\":{\"fuente\":\"doaj\"},\"link\":{\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1371\\/journal.pmed.1003012\"},\"titulo\":{\"title\":\"Dysregulation of multiple metabolic networks related to brain transmethylation and polyamine pathways in Alzheimer disease: A targeted metabolomic and transcriptomic study.\"}},\"37\":{\"abstract\":{\"abstract\":\"Four cases of congenital, hypotonic-sclerotic muscular dystrophy are presented.

Inheritance can be dominant negative (DN) or recessive depending on the type and location of the mutation. DN mutations allow incorporation of abnormal chains into secreted tetramers and are the most commonly identified mutation type in COL6-RD. Null alleles (nonsense, frameshift, and large deletions) do not allow incorporation of abnormal chains and act recessively.

This disease is caused by causative variants in COL6A1, COL6A2, or COL6A3. Most reported causative variants are de novo; therefore, to identify possible associated causative variants, comprehensive large cohort studies are required for different ethnicities. Methods We retrospectively reviewed clinical information, muscle histology, and genetic analyses from 147 Japanese patients representing 130 families, whose samples were sent for diagnosis to the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry between July 1979 and January 2020. Genetic analyses were conducted by gene-based resequencing, targeted panel resequencing, and whole exome sequencing, in combination with cDNA analysis. Results Of a total of 130 families with 1\\u20135 members with collagen VI-related dystrophy, 120 had mono-allelic and 10 had bi-allelic variants in COL6A1, COL6A2, or COL6A3. Among them, 60 variants were in COL6A1, 57 in COL6A2, and 23 in COL6A3, including 37 novel variants. Mono-allelic variants were classified into four groups: missense (69, 58%), splicing (40, 33%), small in-frame deletion (7, 6%), and large genomic deletion (4, 3%). Variants in the triple helical domains accounted for 88% (105\\/120) of all mono-allelic variants.

Preneoplastic liver lesions in rodents have been extensively characterized histochemically, but adaptation of these techniques to trout livers has not always been successful. Eosinophilic foci consist of hypertrophied cells, enlarged atypical nuclei, and dense glycogen-free cytoplasm. Mitotic figures are also occasionally seen. Usually, these foci have been infiltrated and at least partially destroyed by inflammatory cells, largely lymphocytes. In some liver sections, eosinophilic foci are intact and occasionally an eosinophilic-basophilic transformation can be seen. However, most often basophilic foci appear independently, surrounded by normal hepatocytes, with no indication of a prior eosinophilic stage. The cells of basophilic foci are similar to those of carcinomas: intensely basophilic, mitotically active, devoid of glycogen, and grouped into cords several cells in thickness. These nodules may appropriately be referred to as carcinomas in situ, because the only distinguishing characteristic is the size of the lesion. Attempts at differentiation between benign and malignant liver lesions appear arbitrary. We believe the best classification of the neoplastic liver lesion in trout is a hepatocellular carcinoma because the potential for malignant behavior always exists and, with sufficient time, can often be histologically demonstrated.

All subjects underwent a thorough examination and grouped by the cleft phenotype. The numbers and types of other organic defects were recorded and analyzed statistically using SPSS 17.0. Of 2180 cases reported as having orofacial clefts, 657 (30.1%) had other congenital abnormalities, which were significantly more common in cleft palate (47.9% (329\\\\/687)) than that in cleft lip (10.6% (80\\\\/755)) or cleft lip and palate (33.6% (248\\\\/738)) (P<0.01). In subgroups, unilateral cleft lip and palate had a statistically higher incidence of associated abnormalities than bilateral cleft lip and palate (P<0.01).

The etiology of these OFCs is multifactorial. One of the etiological factors is consanguinity (marriage between blood relatives). There is a lack of literature reporting the number of people affected with OFCs due to consanguinity. Aims: The aim of this study is to report the occurrence of OFC and associated factors in relation to consanguinity from a craniofacial hospital specializing in OFCs, head and neck cancer, and trauma management in South India. Setting and Design: This was a hospital-based study, retrospective case record analysis. Methodology: One thousand two hundred and forty-seven consecutive patients\\' secondary data records with cleft lip (CL), cleft palate (CP) and cleft lip and palate (CL\\\\/P) were collected from January 2007 to July 2009. Statistics: Frequency of consanguinity in relation to OFC was analyzed using Chi-square test according to the nature of clefts and selected demographic features such as sex, region, and religion. Results: A total of 47.2% patients\\' parents had consanguineous marriage. Consanguinity was seen in 60.2% of male and 39.7% of female patients. CL\\\\/P was noticed in 40.9%, followed by CL (36.7%) and CP (22.2%). Males predominated in all types of clefts proportionally with the study population as compared to females. Statistically, significant association (P = 0.04) was seen with consanguinity and CP. Conclusion: Nearly half of the study population had a positive history of consanguinity. Statistically, a significant association was seen between CP and consanguinity. CL\\\\/P cases were the most common type identified, followed by CL and CP. Males predominated in all types of clefts. The prevalence of OFC is high, and there is a potential of congenital disabilities from consanguinity.

Specimens included normal liver, liver in iron overload, hepatocellular carcinoma, angioma and foetal liver. On light microscopy, immunoreactivity was almost exclusively present on sinusoidal lining cells, apparently endothelial cells; the pattern was similar in normal and in iron-loaded liver. A gradient of more enhanced staining in acinar zone II and III was observed. The endothelial localization of the staining was supported by the positivity of the central vein endothelium and of the angiomas. Immunoelectron microscopy on three liver specimens showed positivity on sinusoidal endothelial cells but not on Ito and Kupffer cells. In addition, positivity on rough endoplasmic reticulum vesicles of some hepatocytes was also present. Four hepatocellular carcinomas showed an intense staining in tumour cells, 3 were weakly positive and 3 were negative. In the foetal livers, the central vein endothelium was positive from 21 weeks of gestation onward and additional positivity of zone III sinusoidal endothelial cells was present from 27 weeks on. The present results show that in the liver melanotransferrin has a localization different from Tf and the TfR. These latter molecules are predominantly localized in parenchymal cells. In addition, there does not appear to be a coordinate regulation secondary to iron storage, between melanotransferrin, Tf and the TfR. The observed gradient in the staining pattern in foetal and adult liver specimens further supports the heterogeneity of the endothelial cell population in the liver and suggests a developmental relationship between endothelial cells of sinusoids and central vein.\"},\"autor\":{\"nombres\":\"Autores 140\"},\"fuente\":{\"fuente\":\"ProQuest\"},\"link\":{\"link\":\"http:\\\\/\\\\/dialog.proquest.com\\\\/professional\\\\/docview\\\\/596108683?accountid=173210\"},\"titulo\":{\"title\":\"In situ localization of melanotransferrin (melanoma-associated antigen P97) in human liver.

Objective, grave side effects were only few: one superficial phlebo-thrombosis, 2 cases of thrombophlebitis, one carcinoma in situ of the portio vaginalis uteri and 2 mammary cancers were seen.

HBV DNA sequences were found in the liver of all patients with chronic liver disease and serologic positivity for HBV infection. In liver with normal histologic features, HBV DNA was not demonstrable, despite the positive anti-HBc and anti-HBs. However, a positive HBV DNA was found in 3 serologically negative patients. In another patient the interpretation of findings was impossible because of severe hemosiderosis.

Methapyrilene hydrochloride was administered in the feed to rats at a concentration of 1,000 ppm for periods up to 89 weeks. Groups of rats were killed after 5, 10, 15, 29, 40, or 73 weeks of ingesting the carcinogen. Another group was allowed to live out their life-span. Hepatocellular eosinophilic foci and adenomas were seen after 10 and 15 weeks, respectively. Basophilic foci and adenomas were found after 29 and 40 weeks, respectively. Hepatocellular carcinomas developed in 5 of 10 rats at week 40, in 3 of 5 rats at week 73, and in 19 of 19 rats that lived out their life-span. Carcinomas arose within adenomas or as small in situ carcinomas. The histologic types included trabecular, adenocarcinoma, mixed, and solid poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas. Eleven of the mixed and solid poorly differentiated carcinomas metastasized to the lung. Solid poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas grew upon transplantation to the mammary fat pad of weanling F344 rats. Cholangiocarcinomas were found in 7 of 19 rats only in the life-span group. Mucous cholangiofibrosis was seen in all rats after 15 weeks. With the use of Regaud\\'s mitochondrial stain, an increased cellular density of mitochondria was seen in some hepatocytes of peripheral and central lobular areas and in some hepatocellular carcinoma cells, but not in cells in many of the adenomas and foci. Cellular alpha-fetoprotein was found by immunoperoxidase staining in portions of hepatocellular carcinomas, but not in foci, adenomas, and nonneoplastic areas. The majority of hepatocytes in foci, adenomas, and hepatocellular carcinomas contained gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase.

Understanding how perturbations in metabolism are related to AD is critical to identifying novel targets for disease-modifying therapies. In this study, we test whether AD pathogenesis is associated with dysregulation in brain transmethylation and polyamine pathways.<h4>Methods and findings<\\\\/h4>We first performed targeted and quantitative metabolomics assays using capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) on brain samples from three groups in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) (AD: n = 17; Asymptomatic AD [ASY]: n = 13; Control [CN]: n = 13) (overall 37.2% female; mean age at death 86.118 \\\\u00b1 9.842 years) in regions both vulnerable and resistant to AD pathology. Using linear mixed-effects models within two primary brain regions (inferior temporal gyrus [ITG] and middle frontal gyrus [MFG]), we tested associations between brain tissue concentrations of 26 metabolites and the following primary outcomes: group differences, Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer\\'s Disease (CERAD) (neuritic plaque burden), and Braak (neurofibrillary pathology) scores. We found significant alterations in concentrations of metabolites in AD relative to CN samples, as well as associations with severity of both CERAD and Braak, mainly in the ITG. These metabolites represented biochemical reactions in the (1) methionine cycle (choline: lower in AD, p = 0.003; S-adenosyl methionine: higher in AD, p = 0.005); (2) transsulfuration and glutathione synthesis (cysteine: higher in AD, p < 0.001; reduced glutathione [GSH]: higher in AD, p < 0.001); (3) polyamine synthesis\\\\/catabolism (spermidine: higher in AD, p = 0.004); (4) urea cycle (N-acetyl glutamate: lower in AD, p < 0.001); (5) glutamate-aspartate metabolism (N-acetyl aspartate: lower in AD, p = 0.002); and (6) neurotransmitter metabolism (gamma-amino-butyric acid: lower in AD, p < 0.001). Utilizing three Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets, we then examined mRNA expression levels of 71 genes encoding enzymes regulating key reactions within these pathways in the entorhinal cortex (ERC; AD: n = 25; CN: n = 52) and hippocampus (AD: n = 29; CN: n = 56). Complementing our metabolomics results, our transcriptomics analyses also revealed significant alterations in gene expression levels of key enzymatic regulators of biochemical reactions linked to transmethylation and polyamine metabolism. Our study has limitations: our metabolomics assays measured only a small proportion of all metabolites participating in the pathways we examined. Our study is also cross-sectional, limiting our ability to directly test how AD progression may impact changes in metabolite concentrations or differential-gene expression. Additionally, the relatively small number of brain tissue samples may have limited our power to detect alterations in all pathway-specific metabolites and their genetic regulators.<h4>Conclusions<\\\\/h4>In this study, we observed broad dysregulation of transmethylation and polyamine synthesis\\\\/catabolism, including abnormalities in neurotransmitter signaling, urea cycle, aspartate-glutamate metabolism, and glutathione synthesis. Our results implicate alterations in cellular methylation potential and increased flux in the transmethylation pathways, increased demand on antioxidant defense mechanisms, perturbations in intermediate metabolism in the urea cycle and aspartate-glutamate pathways disrupting mitochondrial bioenergetics, increased polyamine biosynthesis and breakdown, as well as abnormalities in neurotransmitter metabolism that are related to AD.\"},\"autor\":{\"nombres\":\"Autores 534\"},\"fuente\":{\"fuente\":\"doaj\"},\"link\":{\"link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/doi.org\\\\/10.1371\\\\/journal.pmed.1003012\"},\"titulo\":{\"title\":\"Dysregulation of multiple metabolic networks related to brain transmethylation and polyamine pathways in Alzheimer disease: A targeted metabolomic and transcriptomic study.\"}},\"37\":{\"abstract\":{\"abstract\":\"Four cases of congenital, hypotonic-sclerotic muscular dystrophy are presented.

To better assess the transcriptional changes induced by abnormal collagen VI in the extracellular matrix (ECM); we compared transcriptional profiles from subjects with DN mutations and subjects with null mutations to transcriptional profiles from controls.Differentially expressed transcripts between COL6-RD and control fibroblasts include upregulation of ECM components and downregulation of factors controlling matrix remodeling and repair. DN and null samples are differentiated by downregulation of genes involved with DNA replication and repair in null samples.Differentially expressed genes identified here may help identify new targets for development of therapies and biomarkers to assess the efficacy of treatments.\"},\"autor\":{\"nombres\":\"Autores 12\"},\"fuente\":{\"fuente\":\"doaj\"},\"link\":{\"link\":\"http:\\\\/\\\\/europepmc.org\\\\/articles\\\\/PMC5731705?pdf=render\"},\"titulo\":{\"title\":\"Transcriptome profiling identifies regulators of pathogenesis in collagen VI related muscular dystrophy.\"}},\"50\":{\"abstract\":{\"abstract\":\"The 23-year-old was born with Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy, a rare condition which causes muscles to weaken over time.

This disease is caused by causative variants in COL6A1, COL6A2, or COL6A3. Most reported causative variants are de novo; therefore, to identify possible associated causative variants, comprehensive large cohort studies are required for different ethnicities. Methods We retrospectively reviewed clinical information, muscle histology, and genetic analyses from 147 Japanese patients representing 130 families, whose samples were sent for diagnosis to the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry between July 1979 and January 2020. Genetic analyses were conducted by gene-based resequencing, targeted panel resequencing, and whole exome sequencing, in combination with cDNA analysis. Results Of a total of 130 families with 1\\\\u20135 members with collagen VI-related dystrophy, 120 had mono-allelic and 10 had bi-allelic variants in COL6A1, COL6A2, or COL6A3. Among them, 60 variants were in COL6A1, 57 in COL6A2, and 23 in COL6A3, including 37 novel variants. Mono-allelic variants were classified into four groups: missense (69, 58%), splicing (40, 33%), small in-frame deletion (7, 6%), and large genomic deletion (4, 3%). Variants in the triple helical domains accounted for 88% (105\\\\/120) of all mono-allelic variants. Conclusions We report the causative variant profile of a large set of Japanese cases of collagen VI-related dystrophy. This dataset can be used as a reference to support genetic diagnosis and variant-specific treatment.\"},\"autor\":{\"nombres\":\"Autores 9\"},\"fuente\":{\"fuente\":\"doaj\"},\"link\":{\"link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/doi.org\\\\/10.1186\\\\/s13023-021-01921-2\"},\"titulo\":{\"title\":\"Causative variant profile of collagen VI-related dystrophy in Japan\"}},\"53\":{\"abstract\":{\"abstract\":\"This paper reviews both minor and major adverse reactions caused by estrogenic substances (natural and synthetic, steroidal and nonsteroidal) of which diethylstilbestrol is the prototype of nonsteroidal synthetic estrogen.

Two putative preneoplastic lesions have been identified, the eosinophilic focus and the basophilic focus, but whether these correspond to similar lesions in rodent livers is not known. Preneoplastic liver lesions in rodents have been extensively characterized histochemically, but adaptation of these techniques to trout livers has not always been successful. Eosinophilic foci consist of hypertrophied cells, enlarged atypical nuclei, and dense glycogen-free cytoplasm. Mitotic figures are also occasionally seen. Usually, these foci have been infiltrated and at least partially destroyed by inflammatory cells, largely lymphocytes. In some liver sections, eosinophilic foci are intact and occasionally an eosinophilic-basophilic transformation can be seen. However, most often basophilic foci appear independently, surrounded by normal hepatocytes, with no indication of a prior eosinophilic stage. The cells of basophilic foci are similar to those of carcinomas: intensely basophilic, mitotically active, devoid of glycogen, and grouped into cords several cells in thickness. These nodules may appropriately be referred to as carcinomas in situ, because the only distinguishing characteristic is the size of the lesion. Attempts at differentiation between benign and malignant liver lesions appear arbitrary. We believe the best classification of the neoplastic liver lesion in trout is a hepatocellular carcinoma because the potential for malignant behavior always exists and, with sufficient time, can often be histologically demonstrated. We have also described our experience with the characteristics of other liver lesions associated with hepatocarcinogenesis.\"},\"autor\":{\"nombres\":\"Autores 192\"},\"fuente\":{\"fuente\":\"ProQuest\"},\"link\":{\"link\":\"http:\\\\/\\\\/dialog.proquest.com\\\\/professional\\\\/docview\\\\/592602442?accountid=173210\"},\"titulo\":{\"title\":\"Histological progression of hepatic neoplasia in rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri)\"}}}'"

The aim of this study is to assess the incidence of congenital heart diseases and other organic defects associated with different types of orofacial clefts. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: All children with orofacial clefts, which were sought out from the Health Information System of Shanghai Ninth People\\'s Hospital between 1(st) Jan 2009 and 30(th) Dec 2011, were enrolled in this study. All subjects underwent a thorough examination and grouped by the cleft phenotype. The numbers and types of other organic defects were recorded and analyzed statistically using SPSS 17.0. Of 2180 cases reported as having orofacial clefts, 657 (30.1%) had other congenital abnormalities, which were significantly more common in cleft palate (47.9% (329\\\\/687)) than that in cleft lip (10.6% (80\\\\/755)) or cleft lip and palate (33.6% (248\\\\/738)) (P<0.01). In subgroups, unilateral cleft lip and palate had a statistically higher incidence of associated abnormalities than bilateral cleft lip and palate (P<0.01). The most common malformation was congenital heart disease, which counted 45.1% (296\\\\/657) of all malformations. Disorders of the central nervous system (14.3%(94\\\\/657)) and Skeletal anomalies (13.1%(86\\\\/657)) were also frequently associated. Additionally, the most common defect in heart was atrial septal defect, which was 39.7% (118\\\\/296) of all congenital heart diseases.

Aims and Objectives: The primary aims of this study was to assess the predominant pattern of cleft lip and palate (CLP) cases in Mangalore and secondary aim is to evaluate the role of possible risk factors like previous familial history, maternal diet and nutritional supplementation, consanguinity. Materials and Methods: This was a 5-year hospital based, retrospective study of the birth records, in which all the cases of CL\\\\/P up to the age group of 5 years were studied. The data was retrieved from the Medical Records Department of two main hospitals in Mangalore. The data was collected using a semi-structured, pre-tested proforma that was designed based on the review of literature. Results: The cleft occurrence in Mangalore was found to be 2.42\\\\/1000 births\\\\/year. Cleft lip (CL) along with cleft palate (CP) was found to be the highest in both Hospitals about (64.6%), followed by isolated CL (28.5%), followed by isolated CP (5.1%) and the least being isolated CL with cleft alveolus (1.9%).

Understanding how perturbations in metabolism are related to AD is critical to identifying novel targets for disease-modifying therapies. In this study, we test whether AD pathogenesis is associated with dysregulation in brain transmethylation and polyamine pathways.<h4>Methods and findings<\\\\/h4>We first performed targeted and quantitative metabolomics assays using capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) on brain samples from three groups in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) (AD: n = 17; Asymptomatic AD [ASY]: n = 13; Control [CN]: n = 13) (overall 37.2% female; mean age at death 86.118 \\\\u00b1 9.842 years) in regions both vulnerable and resistant to AD pathology. Using linear mixed-effects models within two primary brain regions (inferior temporal gyrus [ITG] and middle frontal gyrus [MFG]), we tested associations between brain tissue concentrations of 26 metabolites and the following primary outcomes: group differences, Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer\\'s Disease (CERAD) (neuritic plaque burden), and Braak (neurofibrillary pathology) scores. We found significant alterations in concentrations of metabolites in AD relative to CN samples, as well as associations with severity of both CERAD and Braak, mainly in the ITG. These metabolites represented biochemical reactions in the (1) methionine cycle (choline: lower in AD, p = 0.003; S-adenosyl methionine: higher in AD, p = 0.005); (2) transsulfuration and glutathione synthesis (cysteine: higher in AD, p < 0.001; reduced glutathione [GSH]: higher in AD, p < 0.001); (3) polyamine synthesis\\\\/catabolism (spermidine: higher in AD, p = 0.004); (4) urea cycle (N-acetyl glutamate: lower in AD, p < 0.001); (5) glutamate-aspartate metabolism (N-acetyl aspartate: lower in AD, p = 0.002); and (6) neurotransmitter metabolism (gamma-amino-butyric acid: lower in AD, p < 0.001). Utilizing three Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets, we then examined mRNA expression levels of 71 genes encoding enzymes regulating key reactions within these pathways in the entorhinal cortex (ERC; AD: n = 25; CN: n = 52) and hippocampus (AD: n = 29; CN: n = 56). Complementing our metabolomics results, our transcriptomics analyses also revealed significant alterations in gene expression levels of key enzymatic regulators of biochemical reactions linked to transmethylation and polyamine metabolism. Our study has limitations: our metabolomics assays measured only a small proportion of all metabolites participating in the pathways we examined. Our study is also cross-sectional, limiting our ability to directly test how AD progression may impact changes in metabolite concentrations or differential-gene expression. Additionally, the relatively small number of brain tissue samples may have limited our power to detect alterations in all pathway-specific metabolites and their genetic regulators.<h4>Conclusions<\\\\/h4>In this study, we observed broad dysregulation of transmethylation and polyamine synthesis\\\\/catabolism, including abnormalities in neurotransmitter signaling, urea cycle, aspartate-glutamate metabolism, and glutathione synthesis. Our results implicate alterations in cellular methylation potential and increased flux in the transmethylation pathways, increased demand on antioxidant defense mechanisms, perturbations in intermediate metabolism in the urea cycle and aspartate-glutamate pathways disrupting mitochondrial bioenergetics, increased polyamine biosynthesis and breakdown, as well as abnormalities in neurotransmitter metabolism that are related to AD.\"},\"autor\":{\"nombres\":\"Autores 534\"},\"fuente\":{\"fuente\":\"doaj\"},\"link\":{\"link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/doi.org\\\\/10.1371\\\\/journal.pmed.1003012\"},\"titulo\":{\"title\":\"Dysregulation of multiple metabolic networks related to brain transmethylation and polyamine pathways in Alzheimer disease: A targeted metabolomic and transcriptomic study.\"}},\"12\":{\"abstract\":{\"abstract\":\"ObjectiveTo investigate the expression features and clinical significance of the microRNA-888 (miRNA-888) gene family members in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

On light microscopy, immunoreactivity was almost exclusively present on sinusoidal lining cells, apparently endothelial cells; the pattern was similar in normal and in iron-loaded liver. A gradient of more enhanced staining in acinar zone II and III was observed. The endothelial localization of the staining was supported by the positivity of the central vein endothelium and of the angiomas.

Inheritance can be dominant negative (DN) or recessive depending on the type and location of the mutation. DN mutations allow incorporation of abnormal chains into secreted tetramers and are the most commonly identified mutation type in COL6-RD. Null alleles (nonsense, frameshift, and large deletions) do not allow incorporation of abnormal chains and act recessively. To better define the pathways disrupted by mutations in collagen VI, we have used a transcriptional profiling approach with RNA-Seq to identify differentially expressed genes in COL6-RD individuals from controls.RNA-Seq allows precise detection of all expressed transcripts in a sample and provides a tool for quantification of expression data on a genomic scale. We have used RNA-Seq to identify differentially expressed genes in cultured dermal fibroblasts from 13 COL6-RD individuals (8 dominant negative and 5 null) and 6 controls. To better assess the transcriptional changes induced by abnormal collagen VI in the extracellular matrix (ECM); we compared transcriptional profiles from subjects with DN mutations and subjects with null mutations to transcriptional profiles from controls.Differentially expressed transcripts between COL6-RD and control fibroblasts include upregulation of ECM components and downregulation of factors controlling matrix remodeling and repair. DN and null samples are differentiated by downregulation of genes involved with DNA replication and repair in null samples.Differentially expressed genes identified here may help identify new targets for development of therapies and biomarkers to assess the efficacy of treatments.\"},\"autor\":{\"nombres\":\"Autores 12\"},\"fuente\":{\"fuente\":\"doaj\"},\"link\":{\"link\":\"http:\\\\/\\\\/europepmc.org\\\\/articles\\\\/PMC5731705?pdf=render\"},\"titulo\":{\"title\":\"Transcriptome profiling identifies regulators of pathogenesis in collagen VI related muscular dystrophy.\"}},\"26\":{\"abstract\":{\"abstract\":\"A 5-year old girl with Ullrich\\'s atonic-sclerotic muscular dystrophy is reported and 16 previously reported cases are reviewed.

Methapyrilene hydrochloride was administered in the feed to rats at a concentration of 1,000 ppm for periods up to 89 weeks. Groups of rats were killed after 5, 10, 15, 29, 40, or 73 weeks of ingesting the carcinogen. Another group was allowed to live out their life-span. Hepatocellular eosinophilic foci and adenomas were seen after 10 and 15 weeks, respectively. Basophilic foci and adenomas were found after 29 and 40 weeks, respectively. Hepatocellular carcinomas developed in 5 of 10 rats at week 40, in 3 of 5 rats at week 73, and in 19 of 19 rats that lived out their life-span. Carcinomas arose within adenomas or as small in situ carcinomas. The histologic types included trabecular, adenocarcinoma, mixed, and solid poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas. Eleven of the mixed and solid poorly differentiated carcinomas metastasized to the lung. Solid poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas grew upon transplantation to the mammary fat pad of weanling F344 rats. Cholangiocarcinomas were found in 7 of 19 rats only in the life-span group. Mucous cholangiofibrosis was seen in all rats after 15 weeks. With the use of Regaud\\'s mitochondrial stain, an increased cellular density of mitochondria was seen in some hepatocytes of peripheral and central lobular areas and in some hepatocellular carcinoma cells, but not in cells in many of the adenomas and foci. Cellular alpha-fetoprotein was found by immunoperoxidase staining in portions of hepatocellular carcinomas, but not in foci, adenomas, and nonneoplastic areas. The majority of hepatocytes in foci, adenomas, and hepatocellular carcinomas contained gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase.

There is a lack of literature reporting the number of people affected with OFCs due to consanguinity. Aims: The aim of this study is to report the occurrence of OFC and associated factors in relation to consanguinity from a craniofacial hospital specializing in OFCs, head and neck cancer, and trauma management in South India. Setting and Design: This was a hospital-based study, retrospective case record analysis. Methodology: One thousand two hundred and forty-seven consecutive patients\\' secondary data records with cleft lip (CL), cleft palate (CP) and cleft lip and palate (CL\\\\/P) were collected from January 2007 to July 2009. Statistics: Frequency of consanguinity in relation to OFC was analyzed using Chi-square test according to the nature of clefts and selected demographic features such as sex, region, and religion. Results: A total of 47.2% patients\\' parents had consanguineous marriage. Consanguinity was seen in 60.2% of male and 39.7% of female patients. CL\\\\/P was noticed in 40.9%, followed by CL (36.7%) and CP (22.2%). Males predominated in all types of clefts proportionally with the study population as compared to females. Statistically, significant association (P = 0.04) was seen with consanguinity and CP. Conclusion: Nearly half of the study population had a positive history of consanguinity. Statistically, a significant association was seen between CP and consanguinity. CL\\\\/P cases were the most common type identified, followed by CL and CP. Males predominated in all types of clefts. The prevalence of OFC is high, and there is a potential of congenital disabilities from consanguinity.

Mono-allelic variants were classified into four groups: missense (69, 58%), splicing (40, 33%), small in-frame deletion (7, 6%), and large genomic deletion (4, 3%). Variants in the triple helical domains accounted for 88% (105\\\\/120) of all mono-allelic variants. Conclusions We report the causative variant profile of a large set of Japanese cases of collagen VI-related dystrophy. This dataset can be used as a reference to support genetic diagnosis and variant-specific treatment.\"},\"autor\":{\"nombres\":\"Autores 9\"},\"fuente\":{\"fuente\":\"doaj\"},\"link\":{\"link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/doi.org\\\\/10.1186\\\\/s13023-021-01921-2\"},\"titulo\":{\"title\":\"Causative variant profile of collagen VI-related dystrophy in Japan\"}},\"47\":{\"abstract\":{\"abstract\":\"The histological progression of hepatic neoplasia has not been as systematically studied in rainbow trout as it has been in rodents. Two putative preneoplastic lesions have been identified, the eosinophilic focus and the basophilic focus, but whether these correspond to similar lesions in rodent livers is not known. Preneoplastic liver lesions in rodents have been extensively characterized histochemically, but adaptation of these techniques to trout livers has not always been successful. Eosinophilic foci consist of hypertrophied cells, enlarged atypical nuclei, and dense glycogen-free cytoplasm. Mitotic figures are also occasionally seen. Usually, these foci have been infiltrated and at least partially destroyed by inflammatory cells, largely lymphocytes. In some liver sections, eosinophilic foci are intact and occasionally an eosinophilic-basophilic transformation can be seen. However, most often basophilic foci appear independently, surrounded by normal hepatocytes, with no indication of a prior eosinophilic stage. The cells of basophilic foci are similar to those of carcinomas: intensely basophilic, mitotically active, devoid of glycogen, and grouped into cords several cells in thickness. These nodules may appropriately be referred to as carcinomas in situ, because the only distinguishing characteristic is the size of the lesion. Attempts at differentiation between benign and malignant liver lesions appear arbitrary. We believe the best classification of the neoplastic liver lesion in trout is a hepatocellular carcinoma because the potential for malignant behavior always exists and, with sufficient time, can often be histologically demonstrated. We have also described our experience with the characteristics of other liver lesions associated with hepatocarcinogenesis.\"},\"autor\":{\"nombres\":\"Autores 192\"},\"fuente\":{\"fuente\":\"ProQuest\"},\"link\":{\"link\":\"http:\\\\/\\\\/dialog.proquest.com\\\\/professional\\\\/docview\\\\/592602442?accountid=173210\"},\"titulo\":{\"title\":\"Histological progression of hepatic neoplasia in rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri)\"}},\"48\":{\"abstract\":{\"abstract\":\"This paper reviews both minor and major adverse reactions caused by estrogenic substances (natural and synthetic, steroidal and nonsteroidal) of which diethylstilbestrol is the prototype of nonsteroidal synthetic estrogen.  Minor side effects include nausea, breast tenderness, and excessive cervical secretions (most common), headache, and water and salt retention (less common and often eradicated by lowering estrogen dosage).  Vertigo, yeast infections, depression, and photosensitivity are other minor effects.  Major side effects are discussed in some detail.  Major effects include those on the endocrine system (e.g., feminization in boys and men and precocious puberty in girls); breast tumors; endometrial carcinoma; ovarian tumors; hypertension; thromboembolism; blood clotting excesses; various metabolic effects (including lipid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism alterations); liver changes (bile alterations and neoplasms); porphyria; melanoma; and effects on a fetus in situ during maternal estrogen administration.  In general, lowering doses of estrogen should help eradicate or alleviate most of these effects.\"},\"autor\":{\"nombres\":\"Autores 215\"},\"fuente\":{\"fuente\":\"ProQuest\"},\"link\":{\"link\":\"http:\\\\/\\\\/dialog.proquest.com\\\\/professional\\\\/docview\\\\/590845814?accountid=173210\"},\"titulo\":{\"title\":\"Clinical toxicology of estrogens\"}},\"49\":{\"abstract\":{\"abstract\":\"When the parent smoked during pregnancy, there were increased risks of a baby being born with an orofacial cleft (defect of lip and\\\\/or palate), or having ...\"},\"autor\":{\"nombres\":\"Autores 519\"},\"fuente\":{\"fuente\":\"google\"},\"link\":{\"link\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/nptelegraph.com\\\\/lifestyles\\\\/study-secondhand-smoke-can-harm-unborn-babies\\\\/article_21c8ba46-d142-11eb-8825-2fd19cb6b3d0.html\"},\"titulo\":{\"title\":\"Study: Secondhand smoke can harm unborn babies\"}}}'"
